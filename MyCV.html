<br>
<p>I have a weeks work experience in Mcolls at The Cabin, inwhich i learnt the skills needed to ensure that customer relations
are at the highest of quality to ensure that each customer had the best experiance that they could have.</p>

<p> I also have a weeks work experiance at Greencorn IT solutions in which i built a handful for computer for them,
created tickets for them and helped fix a computer whilst using TeamViewer to take external control of the customers computer.
I did many other things for Greencorn whilst i worked there including programming a raspberry pi and connecting it to a TV and using it
to display the multiple tickets that had been opened.</p>
<p>I also got to install a retailers beta version of Windows 10 before it came out for commersial use,
This was a good learning experiance because i set up a document explaing the changes so that the rest of the staff would know about the changes before they
got to use the new version of windows.</p>

<h2> Young Enterprise </h2>
<p>___________________</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to attend the Young Enterprise challenge in which many people much like myself created a business
and the idea was to become successful! For the our business i was part of the IT team and created the website and the winning advert.</p>
<p>Not only did Blink! win the best advert award we also won two other awards, at one of our events
and the other award that we won was the blue riband award of Best Presentation at the inaugural Dragon’s Den event against 12 other businesses. 
<p>We help weekly meetings in which we reviewd what we had accomplised during that week and then if anything was needed to be documented or reported
we would do this during our hour meeting. We would also discuss many different ideas for what we can create and as when we started we wanted to create
beer mats that saved lives we changed to a more rustic feel and went with wooden coasters and only used upcycled wood for our products. and seeing as how
i was the only one who did resistant materials in our team it seemed logical that i created these coasters and so i started the production of our coasters.
The journey that i took during the Young Enterprise year was very benifical for me as a learnt many life lessons not the least is that although you may trust some peoplet
they can still let you down and in the end compromise can benefit the business more than you may think.</p>
